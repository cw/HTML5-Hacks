<h1>Welcome to {{ config.SITE_NAME }}</h1>
<!--
<p>HTML5 represents a shift from the desktop as a primary computing
device towards a more ubiquitous mobile computing environment. Eventually devices everywhere will have at their
disposal incredibly powerful User Interfaces that can interact with device sensors 
resulting in a feedback loop that will help accelerate the force of
technology on this planet and beyond.</p>
<p>While many modern mobile devices aren't yet capable of the full range of new technologies
incorporated into the HTML5 umbrella, this site intends to show the power of two
elements: svg and canvas.</p>
-->
<p>This site is my experimentation lab as I learn about the family of
technologies which fall under the <a
    href="http://diveintohtml5.org/introduction.html#one">HTML5 umbrella</a>.</p>
